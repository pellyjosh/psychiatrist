1. Introduction
Hubolux Technologies proposes the design and development of a modern, secure, and feature-rich medical consultation website for a Psychiatry PLLC. The platform will serve as a professional digital hub for patients seeking psychiatric care and providers offering consultations.
The system will be designed with two main roles:
•	Patient Platform: For patients to explore services, learn about providers, book appointments, and access helpful resources.
•	Admin/Provider Panel: For practice administrators and psychiatrists to manage appointments, update content, and monitor engagement.
The website will focus on clarity, professionalism, and accessibility, ensuring ease of use across all devices. It will also be designed with scalability in mind, allowing future enhancements such as telehealth integration, secure patient portals, and advanced reporting without requiring a full rebuild.
