# Professional Photo Placeholder

This is a placeholder for Dr. Lola Akinola's professional photo.

## To add the actual photo:

1. Save the professional photo as `dr-akinola.jpg` in this directory (`/public/img/`)
2. Recommended specifications:
    - Format: JPG or PNG
    - Dimensions: At least 400x400 pixels (square format works best)
    - High quality professional headshot
    - File size: Keep under 1MB for optimal loading

## Current setup:

- The image will display as a circular photo (192x192px)
- If the image fails to load, it will show initials "LA" as fallback
- Alt text is properly set for accessibility

Replace this file with the actual professional photo when ready.
